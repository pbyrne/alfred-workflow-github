GitHub Alfred 2 Workflow
======================

Alfred 2 workflow for interacting with GitHub.

Examples
--------

All actions provide autocomplete to filter from the list of accounts and repos
that your account has access to.

Open a GitHub project's home page:

    repo pbyrne/dotfiles

Open a GitHub project's pull requests page:

    pulls pbyrne/dotfiles

Open a GitHub project's issues page:

    issues pbyrne/dotfiles

WARNING
-------

I'm using this project as an opprotunity to learn Python. The code will
probably be terrible. Use at your own risk.
